<h1><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ko/firefox/addon/kemono_downloader/"> FireFox ADD-ONS </a></h1>

This program was developed based on [tana3n](https://github.com/tana3n)’s program, [fanbox-downloader](https://github.com/tana3n/fanbox-downloader).

Currently, these languages are supported.
<ul>
  <li>Korean</li>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>Japanese</li>
  <li>Russian</li>
</ul>

The differences from the original program are as follows:
・Only can useable at kemono.cr
・Some features have been added and improved

I would like to express my gratitude to 'tana3n' for providing the original code.
